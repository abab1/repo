Socket Programming with C
Implemented Internet of Things concept to design a distributed system in C using TCP Sockets. The System
uses a network of sensors which can sense surrounding areas, smart devices that can be remotely turned on or
off depending on the sensed readings and a gateway that interacts with sensors and smart devices. The
communication between the devices and sensors maintains causal ordering with the help of a vector clock and
the server synchronizes its state with a replica server using the 2PC protocol.
